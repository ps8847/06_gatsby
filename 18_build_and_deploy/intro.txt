1) Make a repo at github : 
    run these two lines of that repo here in terminal   :
         git remote add origin https://github.com/ps8847/gatsby-website.git
         git branch -M main
         git add .
         git commit -m "message"
         git push origin main

    after successfull upload go to netlify and choose ehte option of "deploy with netlify"  , chpose your project and upload it

    now form now on wheneevr you will chnage anything here just push it to github and that willl be reflected to that also
