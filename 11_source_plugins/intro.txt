The sourcing of the dtaa into our gatsBy filesystem is amazing : 

1) first we will installa  plugin to soruce the data .
	one of the famous to inetract with file system is : npm install gatsby-source-filesystem

2) now in gatsby-config.js : 
	plugins: [{
    resolve:`gatsby-source-filesystem`,
    options:{
      name:`notes`,
      path:`${__dirname}/src/notes/`
    }
  }]

  now , we wil have access to the notes folder's all content , 

  To check that . In the http://localhost:8000/___graphq ,, we can run this query below : 
	query MyQuery
	{
  		allFile
		{
    		nodes
			{
      			relativePath
    		}
  		}
	}

3) now if i want to access any other folder's data also , i can add another object like this below : 
	now after running the query again , we wil see it iwll show all the files from both the fodlers ,

	but to show only particular folder's data only we can do it like this : 

	query MyQuery {
		allFile(filter : {sourceInstanceName : {eq : "notes"}}){
    	nodes{
      		relativePath
    		}
  		}
	}
